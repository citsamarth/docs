Existing Grading System â€“ Revised (2024 Onwards)

For awarding grades, the institute follows a **relative grading system**.

### Relative Grading Formula

A = (Xmax - (mean / 2)) / 7  
where,  
- Xmax = highest marks in the course  
- mean = arithmetic mean of all students' marks

### Grade Points Table

| Grade | Grade Point | Description |
|:------:|:------------:|:------------|
| AA | 10 | Excellent |
| AB | 9 | Very Good |
| BB | 8 | Good |
| BC | 7 | Above Average |
| CC | 6 | Average |
| DD | 4 | Pass |
| FP | 0 | Fail |
| I | 0 | Intermediate Grade |
| FA | 0 | Fail due to Attendance |

## Grade Range Calculation

| Lower Limit of Marks | Grade | Upper Limit of Marks |
| -------------------- | :---: | -------------------- |
| (mean / 2 + 6A) â‰¤    |  AA   | â‰¤ Xmax               |
| (mean / 2 + 5A) â‰¤    |  AB   | < (mean / 2 + 6A)    |
| (mean / 2 + 4A) â‰¤    |  BB   | < (mean / 2 + 5A)    |
| (mean / 2 + 3A) â‰¤    |  BC   | < (mean / 2 + 4A)    |
| (mean / 2 + 2A) â‰¤    |  CC   | < (mean / 2 + 3A)    |
| (mean / 2 + A) â‰¤     |  CD   | < (mean / 2 + 2A)    |
| (mean / 2) â‰¤         |  DD   | < (mean / 2 + A)     |
|                      |  FP   | < (mean / 2)         |

## SGPA & CGPA Calculation

**SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)**  
SGPA = (C1Ã—G1 + C2Ã—G2 + C3Ã—G3 + â€¦ + CnÃ—Gn) Ã· (C1 + C2 + C3 + â€¦ + Cn)

**CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)**  
CGPA = (C1Ã—G1 + C2Ã—G2 + C3Ã—G3 + â€¦ + CmÃ—Gm) Ã· (C1 + C2 + C3 + â€¦ + Cm)

where:  
- n = number of courses in the semester  
- m = number of courses up to that semester  
- Ci = credits allotted to course i  
- Gi = grade point for course i

---

## CGPA to Percentage Conversion

| Condition | Formula for % of Marks |
|------------|------------------------|
| CGPA â‰¥ 9.0 | % = (CGPA Ã— 15) â€“ 50 |
| CGPA < 9.0 | % = (CGPA Ã— 10) â€“ 5 |

## Modifications (Effective 2024 Onwards)

The same relative grading system continues with the following additional provisions:

### (a) Course Instructor Responsibilities
- Each instructor sets the **maximum expected marks** for awarding â€˜AAâ€™.  
- For courses taught by multiple instructors, they decide this collectively.  
- **Minimum passing marks:**
  1. If (mean / 2) â‰¥ 30%, use it as pass mark.  
  2. If (mean / 2) < 30%, increase it by 10%.

### (b) Adjustment for High Failure Rate
If there is an unusually high number of failures:  
- The HoD, course instructor, and Departmental Program Committee decide new **pass mark** and **AA maximum mark**.

### (c) Supplementary Examination
- Students failing initially get grade **â€˜Iâ€™ (Intermediate)**.  
- Supplementary exam within **15 days** of results.  
- If passed â†’ maximum grade **â€˜BCâ€™**.  
- If failed â†’ grade **â€˜FPâ€™**.  
- Students with â€˜FPâ€™ may reappear as **Compartmental candidates** with the next regular batch.

### (d) Compartmental Examination
- For students with **â€˜FAâ€™ (attendance fail)** or who missed supplementary exam.  
- If passed â†’ maximum grade **â€˜BBâ€™**.

### (e) Audit / Non-Credit Courses
- Grades: **â€˜PPâ€™ (Pass)** or **â€˜FPâ€™ (Fail)**.  
- Examination procedure same as credit courses.

### (f) Credit Transfer from MOOC
- Institute will follow **UGC/AICTE** guidelines for transferring credits.

### (g) Classification Based on CGPA

| CGPA Range | Classification |
|-------------|----------------|
| â‰¥ 8.5 | First Class with Distinction |
| â‰¥ 6.5 and < 8.5 | First Class |
| â‰¥ 5.5 and < 6.5 | Second Class |
