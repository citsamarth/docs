Existing Grading System – Revised (2024 Onwards)

For awarding grades, the institute follows a **relative grading system**.

### Relative Grading Formula

A = (Xmax - (mean / 2)) / 7  
where,  
- Xmax = highest marks in the course  
- mean = arithmetic mean of all students' marks

---

### Grade Points Table

| Grade | Grade Point | Description |
|:------:|:------------:|:------------|
| AA | 10 | Excellent |
| AB | 9 | Very Good |
| BB | 8 | Good |
| BC | 7 | Above Average |
| CC | 6 | Average |
| DD | 4 | Pass |
| FP | 0 | Fail |
| I | 0 | Intermediate Grade |
| FA | 0 | Fail due to Attendance |

---

### Grade Range Calculation

| Lower Limit of Marks | Grade | Upper Limit of Marks |
| -------------------- | :---: | -------------------- |
| (mean / 2 + 6A) ≤    |  AA   | ≤ Xmax               |
| (mean / 2 + 5A) ≤    |  AB   | < (mean / 2 + 6A)    |
| (mean / 2 + 4A) ≤    |  BB   | < (mean / 2 + 5A)    |
| (mean / 2 + 3A) ≤    |  BC   | < (mean / 2 + 4A)    |
| (mean / 2 + 2A) ≤    |  CC   | < (mean / 2 + 3A)    |
| (mean / 2 + A) ≤     |  CD   | < (mean / 2 + 2A)    |
| (mean / 2) ≤         |  DD   | < (mean / 2 + A)     |
|                      |  FP   | < (mean / 2)         |

### SGPA & CGPA Calculation

**SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)**  
SGPA = (C1×G1 + C2×G2 + C3×G3 + … + Cn×Gn) ÷ (C1 + C2 + C3 + … + Cn)

**CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)**  
CGPA = (C1×G1 + C2×G2 + C3×G3 + … + Cm×Gm) ÷ (C1 + C2 + C3 + … + Cm)

where:  
- n = number of courses in the semester  
- m = number of courses up to that semester  
- Ci = credits allotted to course i  
- Gi = grade point for course i

---

### CGPA to Percentage Conversion

| Condition | Formula for % of Marks |
|------------|------------------------|
| CGPA ≥ 9.0 | % = (CGPA × 15) – 50 |
| CGPA < 9.0 | % = (CGPA × 10) – 5 |

---

### Modifications (Effective 2024 Onwards)

The same relative grading system continues with the following additional provisions:

#### (a) Course Instructor Responsibilities
- Each instructor sets the **maximum expected marks** for awarding ‘AA’.  
- For courses taught by multiple instructors, they decide this collectively.  
- **Minimum passing marks:**
  1. If (mean / 2) ≥ 30%, use it as pass mark.  
  2. If (mean / 2) < 30%, increase it by 10%.

#### (b) Adjustment for High Failure Rate
If there is an unusually high number of failures:  
- The HoD, course instructor, and Departmental Program Committee decide new **pass mark** and **AA maximum mark**.

#### (c) Supplementary Examination
- Students failing initially get grade **‘I’ (Intermediate)**.  
- Supplementary exam within **15 days** of results.  
- If passed → maximum grade **‘BC’**.  
- If failed → grade **‘FP’**.  
- Students with ‘FP’ may reappear as **Compartmental candidates** with the next regular batch.

#### (d) Compartmental Examination
- For students with **‘FA’ (attendance fail)** or who missed supplementary exam.  
- If passed → maximum grade **‘BB’**.

#### (e) Audit / Non-Credit Courses
- Grades: **‘PP’ (Pass)** or **‘FP’ (Fail)**.  
- Examination procedure same as credit courses.

#### (f) Credit Transfer from MOOC
- Institute will follow **UGC/AICTE** guidelines for transferring credits.

#### (g) Classification Based on CGPA

| CGPA Range | Classification |
|-------------|----------------|
| ≥ 8.5 | First Class with Distinction |
| ≥ 6.5 and < 8.5 | First Class |
| ≥ 5.5 and < 6.5 | Second Class |
